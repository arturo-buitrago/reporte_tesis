\section{LEACH}
As stated in the previous chapter, LEACH was of particular interest to us due to the influence it had had on so many other clustering algorithms in the field of WSNs (see section \ref{LEACH}). The presence of not only the expected point density $\lambda$ but also the cluster head activation probability $P_{LEACH}$ raised many questions about how the network would react to changes in both. 

In order to investigate this, we decided that
