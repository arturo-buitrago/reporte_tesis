abstract = {The principal aims of the project financed by the Italian Ministry of University and Scientific and Technological Research were: to verify if at the current limit values early biological effects can be demonstrated; to identify the levels of internal dose that can cause early effects; to evaluate the non-occupational factors that can contribute to the levels of internal dose. In particular, the mercury intake derived from dental amalgams and fish consumption was considered. The internal dose was measured with the traditional biological indicators (urinary and blood mercury) and with the speciation of a large percentage of biological samples by ICP-MS. The central nervous system, neuroendocrine function, kidney and the immune system were considered as target organs and were examined using previously standardized indicators of effects. Two groups of subjects were included in the study: workers with occupational exposure to inorganic mercury in different industrial settings and control subjects identified from the general population. The first group was characterized by an exposure level to inorganic mercury clearly below the current limit values; whereas the HgU levels of a relevant number of control subjects were similar to those measured in the exposed subjects. The in vitro studies covered several issues: the percutaneous absorption of mercury using skin derived from human post-mortem samples in a standardized model; the release of the metal from dental amalgams in different physiological conditions of the oral cavity; the effects of increasing doses of mercury chloride on tubular renal cells. The project was realized with the cooperation of seven Research Units from six Italian Universities. Researchers belonging to Departments of Occupational Medicine, Industrial Hygiene, General Pathology, Biochemistry, Odontology, and Biostatistics were involved to achieve a multidisciplinary approach. The results of this research project are described and discussed in the following papers.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently gained the attention of researchers in many challenging aspects. The most important challenge in these networks is energy conservation. One of the most popular solutions in making WSNs energy-efficient is to cluster the networks. In clustering, the nodes are divided into some clusters and then some nodes, called cluster-heads, are selected to be the head of each cluster. In a typical clustered WSN, the regular nodes sense the field and send their data to the cluster-head, then, after gathering and aggregating the data, the cluster-head transmits them to the base station. Clustering the nodes in WSNs has many benefits, including scalability, energy-efficiency, and reducing routing delay. In this paper we present a state-of-the-art and comprehensive survey on clustering approaches. We first begin with the objectives of clustering, clustering characteristics, and then present a classification on the clustering algorithms in WSNs. Some of the clustering objectives considered in this paper include scalability, fault-tolerance, data aggregation/fusion, increased connectivity, load balancing, and collision avoidance. Then, we survey the proposed approaches in the past few years in a classified manner and compare them based on different metrics such as mobility, cluster count, cluster size, and algorithm complexity.},

abstract = {Clustering provides an effective method for prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. Current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques; selecting cluster heads with more residual energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and extend the network lifetime. However, they rarely consider the hot spot problem in multihop sensor networks. When cluster heads cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station, the cluster heads closer to the base station are burdened with heavier relay traffic and tend to die much faster, leaving areas of the network uncovered and causing network partitions. To mitigate the hot spot problem, we propose an Unequal Cluster-based Routing (UCR) protocol. It groups the nodes into clusters of unequal sizes. Cluster heads closer to the base station have smaller cluster sizes than those farther from the base station, thus they can preserve some energy for the inter-cluster data forwarding. A greedy geographic and energy-aware routing protocol is designed for the inter-cluster communication, which considers the tradeoff between the energy cost of relay paths and the residual energy of relay nodes. Simulation results show that UCR mitigates the hot spot problem and achieves an obvious improvement on the network lifetime.},

abstract = {— An integral aspect of radio propagation especially outside of buildings is the loss due to shadow fading (also known as long-term fading). This is caused by the presence of obstacles which lie in the propagation path of the radio waves. While modeling the shadow fading loss, the spatial, angular and temporal correlation of the shadow fading values has to be considered. By that, it is taken into account that an obstacle which lied in the propagation path during the last measurement of the radio wave cannot simply disappear at the following measurement. Moreover, signals coming from the same direction experience a similar shadow effect and the location dependency of the shadow fading values makes sure that another mobile at the same location also gets the same signal attenuation. This article aims at generating shadow fading profiles which can be used in simulations of realistic mobile radio network scenarios. The focus is on achieving two-dimensional spatial correlation of the shadow fading values. Methods for introducing the angular and temporal correlation are explained in addition. Simulations with the different shadow fading profiles are run and comparisons between quality-of-service (QoS) aspects obtained with these profiles are presented.},

abstract = {Advances in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have enabled small and low-cost sensors with the capability of sensing various types of physical and environmental conditions, data processing, and wireless communication. In the WSN, the sensor nodes have a limited transmission range and their processing and storage capabilities as well as their energy resources are limited. A triple umpiring system has already been proved for its better performance in WSNs. The clustering technique is effective in prolonging the lifetime of the WSN. In this study, we have modified the ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing by incorporating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based dynamic clustering. The proposed scheme, which is an efficient and secure routing protocol for wireless sensor networks through SNR-based dynamic clustering (ESRPSDC) mechanisms, can partition the nodes into clusters and select the cluster head (CH) among the nodes based on the energy, and non CH nodes join with a specific CH based on the SNR values. Error recovery has been implemented during the inter-cluster routing in order to avoid end-to-end error recovery. Security has been achieved by isolating the malicious nodes using sink-based routing pattern analysis. Extensive investigation studies using a global mobile simulator have shown that this hybrid ESRP significantly improves the energy efficiency and packet reception rate as compared with the SNR unaware routing algorithms such as the low energy aware adaptive clustering hierarchy and power efficient gathering in sensor information systems.},

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster based station (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

abstract = {Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operating the sensor network for a long period of time. The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy {\{}{\&}{\}}times; delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy {\{}{\&}{\}}times; delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy {\{}{\&}{\}}times; delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the LEACH protocol.},

abstract = {Clustering significantly reduces the energy consumption of each individual sensor in a wireless sensor network (WSN), and also increases the communication load on cluster heads. Because of the unbalanced energy consumption among cluster heads, the hot spots problem will arise when using the multihop forwarding model for the intercluster communication. Unequal clustering is an effective way to balance the energy consumption of cluster heads. In this paper, we present an Energy-Balancing unequal Clustering Approach for Gradient-based routing (EBCAG) in wireless sensor networks. It partitions the nodes into clusters of unequal size, and each sensor node maintains a gradient value, which is defined as its minimum hop count to the sink. The size of a cluster is decided by the gradient value of its cluster head, and the data gathered from the cluster members should follow the direction of descending gradient to reach the sink. Simulation results show that EBCAG balances the energy consumption among the cluster heads, and significantly improves the network lifetime.},

In this paper, we focus on applying 3GPP LTE release 8 technology to build a high-reliable and low-latency Distribution Automation (DA) network. Based on the documents released by Nation Institute of Standard and Technologies, the communication requirements of DA are obtained, which include traffic distributions, latency constraint and reliability requirement. The latency and reliability requirements are tightly coupled in the DA network. In order to mitigate queueing delay, we reserve bandwidth only for the devices with low duty cycle random traffics. By maintaining all field devices in RRC-CONNECTED state, the scheduling delay can be decreased to 66 ms as maximum, this leaves time to complete three retransmissions of devices' data. Finally, the uplink and downlink cell-edge Interference-plus-Noise Ratios are estimated through system level simulation. The reliability requirements of DA can be satisfied with 4-by-2 Transmission Mode 6 system in downlink, and with 1-by-4 system in uplink, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that LTE is a promising candidate to build a wireless DA network.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the infrastructure mode wireless machine-to-machine (M2M) network, such as the machine-type communication (MTC) in the LTE-Advanced, where there could be tens of thousands of machines within a macro cell and intending to access the same macro base station. Since most of the M2M communications are of low duty cycle and the machine traffic is usually bursty, the bottleneck forM2M communications is usually at the random access stage. In the LTE-Advanced, the access class barring (ACB) and extended access barring (EAB) have been proposed for the random access of MTC. For the one-shot random access attempts which correspond to the extremely low-duty-cycle scenarios where the network has enough time before the next traffic burst to resolve random access collisions, ACB and EAB have been shown to be sufficient if the machines can tolerate long access delay. However, when the machine traffic is recurrent with higher duty cycle, the ACB and EAB will fail to resolve collisions before the nextwaveoftraffic comes in. To accommodate the M2M traffic and reduce the random access delay under limited random access resource, a clustered network structure is considered for which the machines in a macro cell are divided into clusters, and the machines belonging to a cluster communicate to the cluster head which then aggregates the traffic and relays to the macro base station. This clustered M2M network spatially reuses the random access resource. Thus it can increase the number of machines supported by the network and/or reserve more random access resource for the conventional (human) devices such that their qualities of service will not be affected too much by the M2M communications. Our analysis shows that full reuse of the random access resource among the clusters is feasible. In addition, simulations are conducted to study the random access performance of the clustered network, and to determine the number of clusters that should be formed and the number random access preambles that should be allocated to the machines when the total number of machines is given.},

However, the single fixed threshold value used in previous researches cannot perform well for all videos equally. In this paper, we propose a dynamic threshold method (DTM) in order to improve the performance of the scene change detection. The proposed method utilizes variable parameters obtained from detected cuts and the distribution of cut intervals in order to change the threshold dynamically. In short, the threshold in DTM is lowered in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is high and raised in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is low. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DTM is both computationally low and robust to false alarm.},

abstract = {Abstract—Prolonged network lifetime, scalability, and load balancing are important requirements for many ad-hoc sensor network applications. Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad- hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in  iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the net- work. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.},

In particular, the motivation for the design of PANEL was to support reliable and persistent data storage applications, such as TinyPEDS. PANEL ensures load balancing, and it supports intra-and inter-cluster routing allowing sensor to aggregator, aggregator to aggregator, base station to aggregator, and aggregator to base station communications.

After taking the class, when you're faced with a new problem, you should be able to (1) select appropriate methods, and justify their choice, (2) use and program statistical software to implement them, and (3) critically evaluate the results and communicate them to colleagues in business, science, etc. Data mining is related to statistics and to machine learning, but has its own aims and scope. Statistics is a mathematical science, studying how reliable inferences can be drawn from imperfect data. Machine learning is a branch of engineering, developing a technology of automated induction. We will freely use tools from statistics and from machine learning, but we will use them as tools, not things to study in their own right. We will do a lot of calculations, but will not prove many theorems, and we will do even more experiments than calculations.},

abstract = {— An integral aspect of radio propagation especially outside of buildings is the loss due to shadow fading (also known as long-term fading). This is caused by the presence of obstacles which lie in the propagation path of the radio waves. While modeling the shadow fading loss, the spatial, angular and temporal correlation of the shadow fading values has to be considered. By that, it is taken into account that an obstacle which lied in the propagation path during the last measurement of the radio wave cannot simply disappear at the following measurement. Moreover, signals coming from the same direction experience a similar shadow effect and the location dependency of the shadow fading values makes sure that another mobile at the same location also gets the same signal attenuation. This article aims at generating shadow fading profiles which can be used in simulations of realistic mobile radio network scenarios. The focus is on achieving two-dimensional spatial correlation of the shadow fading values. Methods for introducing the angular and temporal correlation are explained in addition. Simulations with the different shadow fading profiles are run and comparisons between quality-of-service (QoS) aspects obtained with these profiles are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract—Prolonged network lifetime, scalability, and load balancing are important requirements for many ad-hoc sensor network applications. Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad- hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in  iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the net- work. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.},

@article{Lindsey2002,
abstract = {Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operating the sensor network for a long period of time. The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy {\&}times; delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy {\&}times; delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy {\&}times; delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the LEACH protocol.},

abstract = {Wireless distributed microsensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments for both civil and military applications. In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster based station (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

abstract = {Advances in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have enabled small and low-cost sensors with the capability of sensing various types of physical and environmental conditions, data processing, and wireless communication. In the WSN, the sensor nodes have a limited transmission range and their processing and storage capabilities as well as their energy resources are limited. A triple umpiring system has already been proved for its better performance in WSNs. The clustering technique is effective in prolonging the lifetime of the WSN. In this study, we have modified the ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing by incorporating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based dynamic clustering. The proposed scheme, which is an efficient and secure routing protocol for wireless sensor networks through SNR-based dynamic clustering (ESRPSDC) mechanisms, can partition the nodes into clusters and select the cluster head (CH) among the nodes based on the energy, and non CH nodes join with a specific CH based on the SNR values. Error recovery has been implemented during the inter-cluster routing in order to avoid end-to-end error recovery. Security has been achieved by isolating the malicious nodes using sink-based routing pattern analysis. Extensive investigation studies using a global mobile simulator have shown that this hybrid ESRP significantly improves the energy efficiency and packet reception rate as compared with the SNR unaware routing algorithms such as the low energy aware adaptive clustering hierarchy and power efficient gathering in sensor information systems.},

Nevertheless, simulation studies in real deployment scenarios are missing because many system-level simulators do not implement the LTE random access procedure in detail. In this paper, we propose a patch for the LTE module of ns-3, one of the most prominent open-source network simulators, to improve the accuracy of the routine that simulates the LTE Random Access Channel (RACH). The patched version of the random access procedure is compared with the default one and the issues arising from massive synchronous access from mobile terminals in LTE are assessed with a simulation campaign.},

In this paper, we focus on applying 3GPP LTE release 8 technology to build a high-reliable and low-latency Distribution Automation (DA) network. Based on the documents released by Nation Institute of Standard and Technologies, the communication requirements of DA are obtained, which include traffic distributions, latency constraint and reliability requirement. The latency and reliability requirements are tightly coupled in the DA network. In order to mitigate queueing delay, we reserve bandwidth only for the devices with low duty cycle random traffics. By maintaining all field devices in RRC-CONNECTED state, the scheduling delay can be decreased to 66 ms as maximum, this leaves time to complete three retransmissions of devices' data. Finally, the uplink and downlink cell-edge Interference-plus-Noise Ratios are estimated through system level simulation. The reliability requirements of DA can be satisfied with 4-by-2 Transmission Mode 6 system in downlink, and with 1-by-4 system in uplink, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that LTE is a promising candidate to build a wireless DA network.},

Because of the unbalanced energy consumption among cluster heads, the hot spots problem will arise when using the multihop forwarding model for the intercluster communication. Unequal clustering is an effective way to balance the energy consumption of cluster heads. In this paper, we present an Energy-Balancing unequal Clustering Approach for Gradient-based routing (EBCAG) in wireless sensor networks. It partitions the nodes into clusters of unequal size, and each sensor node maintains a gradient value, which is defined as its minimum hop count to the sink. The size of a cluster is decided by the gradient value of its cluster head, and the data gathered from the cluster members should follow the direction of descending gradient to reach the sink. Simulation results show that EBCAG balances the energy consumption among the cluster heads, and significantly improves the network lifetime.},

abstract = {Clustering provides an effective method for prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. Current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques; selecting cluster heads with more residual energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and extend the network lifetime. However, they rarely consider the hot spot problem in multihop sensor networks. When cluster heads cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station, the cluster heads closer to the base station are burdened with heavier relay traffic and tend to die much faster, leaving areas of the network uncovered and causing network partitions. To mitigate the hot spot problem, we propose an Unequal Cluster-based Routing (UCR) protocol. It groups the nodes into clusters of unequal sizes. Cluster heads closer to the base station have smaller cluster sizes than those farther from the base station, thus they can preserve some energy for the inter-cluster data forwarding. A greedy geographic and energy-aware routing protocol is designed for the inter-cluster communication, which considers the tradeoff between the energy cost of relay paths and the residual energy of relay nodes. Simulation results show that UCR mitigates the hot spot problem and achieves an obvious improvement on the network lifetime.},

Assuming that the residual energy of nodes follows the random distribution, we propose a load-balanced clustering algorithm for WSNs on the basis of their distance and density distribution, making it essentially different from the previous clustering algorithms.

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently gained the attention of researchers in many challenging aspects. The most important challenge in these networks is energy conservation. One of the most popular solutions in making WSNs energy-efficient is to cluster the networks. In clustering, the nodes are divided into some clusters and then some nodes, called cluster-heads, are selected to be the head of each cluster. In a typical clustered WSN, the regular nodes sense the field and send their data to the cluster-head, then, after gathering and aggregating the data, the cluster-head transmits them to the base station. Clustering the nodes in WSNs has many benefits, including scalability, energy-efficiency, and reducing routing delay. In this paper we present a state-of-the-art and comprehensive survey on clustering approaches. We first begin with the objectives of clustering, clustering characteristics, and then present a classification on the clustering algorithms in WSNs. Some of the clustering objectives considered in this paper include scalability, fault-tolerance, data aggregation/fusion, increased connectivity, load balancing, and collision avoidance. Then, we survey the proposed approaches in the past few years in a classified manner and compare them based on different metrics such as mobility, cluster count, cluster size, and algorithm complexity.},

However, the single fixed threshold value used in previous researches cannot perform well for all videos equally. In this paper, we propose a dynamic threshold method (DTM) in order to improve the performance of the scene change detection. The proposed method utilizes variable parameters obtained from detected cuts and the distribution of cut intervals in order to change the threshold dynamically. In short, the threshold in DTM is lowered in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is high and raised in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is low. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DTM is both computationally low and robust to false alarm.},

abstract = {Click is a new software architecture for building exible and con gurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classi cation, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router con guration is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets ow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex con gurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet ow driven by transmitting hardware devices, and ow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click con gurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has sixteen elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and IP tunneling con gurations. Extending the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness among ows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple elements at the right place. On conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and exible architecture is compatible with good performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the infrastructure mode wireless machine-to-machine (M2M) network, such as the machine-type communication (MTC) in the LTE-Advanced, where there could be tens of thousands of machines within a macro cell and intending to access the same macro base station. Since most of the M2M communications are of low duty cycle and the machine traffic is usually bursty, the bottleneck forM2M communications is usually at the random access stage. In the LTE-Advanced, the access class barring (ACB) and extended access barring (EAB) have been proposed for the random access of MTC. For the one-shot random access attempts which correspond to the extremely low-duty-cycle scenarios where the network has enough time before the next traffic burst to resolve random access collisions, ACB and EAB have been shown to be sufficient if the machines can tolerate long access delay. However, when the machine traffic is recurrent with higher duty cycle, the ACB and EAB will fail to resolve collisions before the nextwaveoftraffic comes in. To accommodate the M2M traffic and reduce the random access delay under limited random access resource, a clustered network structure is considered for which the machines in a macro cell are divided into clusters, and the machines belonging to a cluster communicate to the cluster head which then aggregates the traffic and relays to the macro base station. This clustered M2M network spatially reuses the random access resource. Thus it can increase the number of machines supported by the network and/or reserve more random access resource for the conventional (human) devices such that their qualities of service will not be affected too much by the M2M communications. Our analysis shows that full reuse of the random access resource among the clusters is feasible. In addition, simulations are conducted to study the random access performance of the clustered network, and to determine the number of clusters that should be formed and the number random access preambles that should be allocated to the machines when the total number of machines is given.},

In such a dense and complex scenario, a more flexible use of spectrum resources is deemed to be the way to meet the growing requirements for data transmission. In particular, this article focuses on Device-to-Device communications and small cell deployments as emerging facilitators of such a demanding and heterogeneous scenario. The pros and cons of both complementary strategies are identified from both a technical and a business point of view, and main standardization activities are discussed. The aim of this article is to identify and describe open challenges and to inspire new areas for research that make viable the next generation of dense networks.},

abstract = {This paper addresses two fundamental and interrelated issues in device-to-device (D2D) enhanced cellular networks. The first issue is how D2D users should access spectrum, and we consider two choices: overlay (orthogonal spectrum between D2D and cellular UEs) and underlay (non-orthogonal). The second issue is how D2D users should choose between communicating directly or via the base station, a choice that depends on distance between the potential D2D transmitter and receiver. We propose a tractable hybrid network model where the positions of mobiles are modeled by random spatial Poisson point process, with which we present a general analytical approach that allows a unified performance evaluation for these questions. Then, we derive analytical rate expressions and apply them to optimize the two D2D spectrum sharing scenarios under a weighted proportional fair utility function. We find that as the proportion of potential D2D mobiles increases, the optimal spectrum partition in the overlay is almost invariant (when D2D mode selection threshold is large) while the optimal spectrum access factor in the underlay decreases. Further, from a coverage perspective, we reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum access factor and the D2D mode selection threshold in the underlay: as more D2D links are allowed (due to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the network should actually make less spectrum available to them to limit their interference.},
